# Introduction
BMInf (Big Model Inference) is a low-resource inference package for large-scale pretrained language models (PLMs). It has following features:

- **Hardware Friendly.** BMInf supports running models with more than 10 billion parameters on a single NVIDIA GTX 1060 GPU in its minimum requirements. Running with better GPUs leads to better performance.
- **Open.** The parameters of models are open. Users can access large models locally with their own machines without applying or accessing an online API.  
- **Comprehensive Ability.**  BMInf supports generative model CPM1 [[1](#ref)], general language model CPM2.1 [[2](#ref)], and dialogue model EVA [[3](#ref)]. The abilities of these models cover text completion, text generation, and dialogue generation.
- **Upgraded Model.** Based on CPM2 [[2](#ref)], the newly upgraded model CPM2.1 is currently supported. Based on continual learning, the text generation ability of CPM2.1 is greatly improved compared to CPM2.
- **Convenient Deployment.** Using BMInf, it will be fast and convenient to develop interesting downstream applications.

## Supported Models

BMInf currently supports these models:

- **CPM2.1.** CPM2.1 is an upgraded version of CPM2 [[1](#ref)], which is a general Chinese pre-trained language model with 11 billion parameters. Based on CPM2, CPM2.1 introduces a generative pre-training task and was trained via the continual learning paradigm. In experiments, CPM2.1 has a better generation ability than CPM2.

- **CPM1.** CPM1 [[2](#ref)] is a generative Chinese pre-trained language model with 2.6 billion parameters. The architecture of CPM1 is similar to GPT [[4](#ref)] and it can be used in various NLP tasks such as conversation, essay generation, cloze test, and language understanding.

- **EVA.** EVA [[3](#ref)] is a Chinese pre-trained dialogue model with 2.8 billion parameters. EVA performs well on many dialogue tasks, especially in the multi-turn interaction of human-bot conversations.

Besides these models, we are now working on adding more PLMs especially large-scale PLMs. We welcome every contributor to add their models to this project by proposing an issue.

## Performances

Here we report the speeds of CPM2 encoder and decoder we have tested on different platforms. You can also run ``benchmark/cpm2/encoder.py`` and ``benchmark/cpm2/decoder.py`` to test the speed on your machine!

| GPU | Encoder Speed (tokens/s) | Decoder Speed (tokens/s) |
|-|-|-|
| NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 | 533 | 1.6
| NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080Ti | 1200 | 12
| NVIDIA GeForce GTX 2080Ti | 2275 | 19
